# PYTHON-Machine-Learning-Coursera-Assignments-Solution
In the [Coursera Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) taught by `Andrew NG`, the exercises are told to be completed in `Octave`. As `Python` has now become the go-to language for ML and as I myself am a `Python` enthusiast, I am trying to solve them in `Python`. 

The main problem is, the given materials of `Coursera` are written in `Octave` and those files are fundamental parts to run this assignment.

[This repository](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments) solved this problem. This repositry contains the `Python` versions of the programming assignments for the Machine Learning online class taught by Professor Andrew Ng. They have written the `Octave` files in `Python` and they also made a submission system which checks and gives verdict if the result is correct or not.

# I will solve THESE PROBLEMS instead of the original Octave ones. So, if you are looking for Octave solutions, it's not the right place to look for. Thank you.
